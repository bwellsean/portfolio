            Hey there! I'm a front-end developer who used to wrangle middle
            schoolers in computer science class. Now, I wrangle code (mostly for
            good, sometimes it puts up a fight ðŸ˜‰). I'm all about making the
            internet a prettier and more functional place using cool stuff like
            React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. My portfolio has a bunch of things
            I've built, including a web app that tries to make sense of all
            those recipes online (RecipeRip) and another that's got AI helping
            students be awesome online (because, you know, the internet can be
            weird). Ultimately, I just want to build things that help people and
            maybe make them smile. So, if you're looking for someone who's
            enthusiastic, maybe a little goofy, and definitely loves to code,
            let's chat!
